# Ork Examples

Ork's proposed serverless workflow orchestration (these are conceptual examples).

## Setup

```bash
# Not yet implemented - these are design proposals
```

## Proposed Usage

### Python-First Approach

```bash
# Run workflows locally (proposed)
ork run parallel_tasks.py
ork run data_pipeline.py
ork run conditional_branching.py
```

### YAML-First Approach

```bash
# Run YAML workflows (proposed)
ork run parallel_tasks.yaml
ork run data_pipeline.yaml
ork run conditional_branching.yaml
```

### Hybrid Approach

```bash
# Python with YAML templates (proposed)
ork run hybrid_workflow.py
```

## Key Differentiators (Proposed)

- No server required (fully serverless)
- No vendor lock-in (runs anywhere)
- Low/no cost at idle
- Local development friendly
- Multi-cloud support

## Examples

- Python examples showing proposed syntax
- YAML examples showing proposed declarative format
- Hybrid examples combining both

These are design proposals, not working implementations.

## Status

🚧 Under development - see main Ork repository for current status
